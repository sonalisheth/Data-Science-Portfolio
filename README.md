# Data Science Portfolio
 
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. It is updated regularly. Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.
Please contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonali-sheth-599896b3/) if you are looking to hire a data scientist.

## Instructions for Python Notebooks
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt (requires Python 3+).

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

## Customer/Employee Segment ML Projects

  [**`Customer churn`**](https://github.com/sonalisheth/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis) is one of the most straightforward [**`customer   retention`**](https://github.com/sonalisheth/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Retention%20Case%20Study) metrics. The customer churn rate refers to the rate at which the customers stop doing business with you. The customer churn can be because your customer has ended the subscription or opted out of renewing a subscription. 
   
   ![customer](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e75ce697581e1d6359b29b46e49e9fa80790420fbb6c6dd84bc13b40dc81f333/68747470733a2f2f6b726973686173747564696f2e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032312f30362f4d61696e2d312e676966)
     
   In case, your churn rate is more than 5-7%, then you should evaluate your customer retention strategy and find out why there may be a problem. The high churn rate shows that your service or product is failing to satisfy your client’s needs or wants.

   For both the cases[**`Customer Churn Analysis`**](https://github.com/sonalisheth/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis), [**`Customer Retention`**](https://github.com/sonalisheth/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Retention%20Case%20Study), I have trained the `Machine Learning Model`, gained insights from data, such as `Data Manipulation`, `Data Visualization`, `Data Analysis` and achieved best accuracy with `HyperParameter Tuning` 
     
   Sometimes, churn rate is referred to as retention rate but both are entirely different metrics.  
     
   Same way, customer and employee retention is made all the more serious by the fact that 1/4th of Americans are thinking about changing jobs this year. According to a new study, “over a quarter of working adults (28%) will contemplate changing jobs in 2016, with 15 percent speculatively looking for new opportunities.” What this means, is that if you don’t take the pro-active approach, you may be in store for some nasty surprises this year.
     
   No matter how high-skill or low-skill the customer/client-facing role, greater employee retention will result in greater customer retention.
     
   The goal with employee attrition and retention is to strike the right balance of holding on to top talent while accepting that some level of attrition is healthy;

   For that reason, I created a Machine Learning Model of [**`Employee Attrition- HR Analytics Project`**](https://github.com/sonalisheth/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/HR%20Analytics%20Project) with detailed insights of `Data Visualization`, `EDA` and with the best `Accuracy` to help big companies control their attrition by understanding which employee could leave so as to provide him/her some incentives to stay back.
